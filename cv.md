I am looking forward to studying web-development properly in order to work as a qualified frontend-developer.  
This desire is caused by several reasons:
* page makeup makes me feel happy, because I like trimming things to look and work really good;
* I like doing such work, which has visible results at once;
* I like working on challenging problems, which require not standard attitude;
* I feel really proud and confident when I can do things which seem hard;
* I want to get more freedom: being a web-developer makes it possible to travel more and to live in other countries for a while;
* I like coffee, and coffee is programmers' favourite drink :coffee:  

### My skills

* use of **Sass** in coding;
* basic knowledge of **JavaScript** (learnt basics at W3Schools and learn.javascript.ru);
* I can use basics of **jQuery** (for example, add slick-slider or other kinds of animation to the web site);
* I can use **Figma**, **Adobe XD** and **Photoshop** in work;
* I can make **web page **layout responsive** and **cross browser**.
